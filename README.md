# Marketing Campaign Customer Segmentation (MIT)

## Description

This project involves segmenting customers using a dataset provided by MIT. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Imputing missing values, correcting data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing univariate and bivariate analyses, generating heatmaps.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and treating outliers.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating a separate dataframe for segmenting and profiling variables.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applying t-SNE and PCA.
6. **Clustering**: Using four different techniques:
   - DBSCAN
   - K-Means
   - K-Medoids
   - Hierarchical Clustering
   - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
7. **Evaluation**: Comparing models using silhouette scores to find the most effective clustering technique.
8. **Segmentation and Recommendations**: Profiling clusters and making recommendations for marketing campaigns.
